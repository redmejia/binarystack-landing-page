        loop : "There are situations where you will have to run a block of code several times. A quick example would be a grocery list, and you want to list all of them. On this situation you can access to each item one by one or just write a block of code that does that for you.\nIf you are coming from other programming language like javascript, python, java, or C++.\nYou have many loop options for example : do while, while, for, for each,  for range(depending on your programming background).\nGo make simple for us, we as Go developers only have for loop, and that is it.",
